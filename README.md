# Example MERN Activities

These were activities I wrote for my classes to better help students understand and familiarize themselves with the MERN stack (i.e. Mongo, Express, and React working together).

  * [01-MERN_Example](https://github.com/clarknielsen/mern-activities/tree/master/01-MERN_Example) was a nearly complete application that just needed a back-end route defined and an Ajax call made to that route in the front-end.

  * [02-Bamazon](https://github.com/clarknielsen/mern-activities/tree/master/02-Bamazon) gave students some starter boilerplate code, but it was up to them to build out this fake storefront in any order they chose.
